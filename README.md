# SG Tweep Python Study Group (2019) Exercise 2

## Objective 
This exercise aims to allow students to practise formatting text and saving the output into a file.

## Scenario & Task
Your client has a ads budget of $100,000 to spend. He/she chooses to spend $2,000 on the first day and for every subsequent day, he/she will increase the spent by 5%. Your task is to generate a report file (report.txt) to show how the budget will be spent each day. 

## Expected Output
report.txt should look like this:

```txt
